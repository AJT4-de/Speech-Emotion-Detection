# Emotion Recognition Model - Performance Summary

## Model Training Results
- **Dataset**: Merged RAVDESS + Emotion Speech Dataset
- **Total Samples**: 3,938 audio files
- **Features**: 196 audio features per sample
- **Test Set Accuracy**: 72% (985 test samples)
- **Model**: RandomForestClassifier
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler

## Supported Emotions
1. Neutral
2. Calm
3. Happy
4. Sad
5. Angry
6. Fearful
7. Surprise

## Validation Results on RAVDESS Subset
- **Files Tested**: 15 samples from 3 actors
- **Overall Accuracy**: 20% (3/15 correct)
- **Breakdown by Emotion**:
  - Calm: 100% accuracy (3/3 correct)
  - Neutral: 0% accuracy (0/12 correct - all misclassified as fearful)

## Key Observations

### Strengths
- Excellent recognition of calm emotions (100% accuracy)
- High confidence scores for correct predictions
- Model successfully loads and makes predictions
- Feature extraction pipeline works correctly

### Areas for Improvement
- Poor neutral emotion recognition (consistently misclassified as fearful)
- Potential class imbalance in training data
- May need additional feature engineering or data augmentation

## Recommendations for Model Improvement

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Investigate class distribution in training data
   - Check for data imbalance between emotions
   - Analyze acoustic similarities between neutral and fearful samples

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Experiment with additional audio features (spectral contrast, tempo, etc.)
   - Try different feature extraction parameters
   - Consider mel-spectrograms or deep learning features

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning for RandomForestClassifier
   - Try other algorithms (SVM, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
   - Implement ensemble methods

4. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Apply audio augmentation techniques (noise addition, pitch shifting, etc.)
   - Balance the dataset using synthetic samples

5. **Cross-Validation**:
   - Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust evaluation
   - Test on different actors/speakers for generalization
